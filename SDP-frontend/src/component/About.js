           <h1>INSURANCE</h1>
           <p>Insurance is a means of protection from financial loss. It is a form of risk management, primarily used to hedge against 
               the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss.An entity which provides insurance is known as an insurer, an insurance company, an insurance carrier or an underwriter.
                A person or entity who buys insurance is known as a policyholder, while a person or entity covered under the policy is called an insured. Policyholder 
                and insured are often used as but are not necessarily synonyms, as coverage can sometimes extend to additional insureds who did not buy the insurance. 
                The insurance transaction involves the policyholder assuming a guaranteed, known, and relatively small loss in the form of payment to the insurer in exchange for the 
                insurer's promise to compensate the insured in the event of a covered loss. The loss may or may not be financial, but it must be reducible to financial terms, and usually 
                involves something in which the insured has an insurable interest established by ownership, possession, or pre-existing relationship.</p>

           <h1>Life Insurance</h1>
           <p>Life insurance (or life assurance, especially in the Commonwealth of Nations) is a contract between an insurance policy holder and an insurer or assurer, where the insurer promises to pay a designated beneficiary a sum of money upon the death of an insured person (often the policy holder). Depending on the contract, other events such as terminal illness or critical illness can also trigger payment. The policy holder typically pays a premium, either regularly or as one lump sum. The benefits may include other expenses, such as funeral expenses.
             Life policies are legal contracts and the terms of each contract describe the limitations of the insured events. Often, specific exclusions written into the contract limit the liability of the insurer; common examples include claims relating to suicide, fraud, war, riot, and civil commotion. Difficulties may arise where an event is not clearly defined, for example: the insured knowingly incurred a risk by consenting to an experimental medical procedure or by taking medication resulting in injury or death.</p>
